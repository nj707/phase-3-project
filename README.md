    R - Read user input/Read clothing on hand for the user
    D - Delete User/Delete Clothing



# User Experience
User experience:

A user will be able to create a profile consisting of their name, and what they currently have in their closet (Minimum of 2 shirts, 2 kinds of pants and 2 shoe options). They then will speak to a stylist and answer questions based on the kind of event they are going. For example if the user is going to a wedding the stylist would ask "Formal or Regular" and after going through the flowchart of formal the user would land on wear a suit and tie. 

# Objective

> This will take the clothes that you have added to your closet and it will make an a general outfit for what general plans you have. Users will create a profile with their name and closet. The clothes can be updated and removed as the user aquires new clothes, or even possibly getting rid of some items.
